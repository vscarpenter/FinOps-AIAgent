# Governance

This project uses a lightweight, maintainer-driven governance model.

## Roles

- Maintainer: Has merge and release rights; triages issues and reviews PRs.
- Contributor: Anyone submitting issues, PRs, or feedback.

## Decision Making

- Lazy consensus for routine changes after review.
- The maintainer has final say on design and roadmap.

## Merging

- All changes land via Pull Request with passing CI and required reviews.
- Only the maintainer merges PRs to `main`.
