# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately to the maintainer:

- Preferred: Open a private report via GitHub Security Advisories

We aim to acknowledge reports within 2 business days and resolve critical
issues as quickly as possible. Please do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly
until a fix is released.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are typically provided for the latest main branch and the most
recent tagged release.

## Disclosure Policy

- We confirm the issue and assess impact/severity.
- We develop and test a fix.
- We coordinate a release and publish an advisory crediting the reporter.
