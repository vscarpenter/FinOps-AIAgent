  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Metrics recording for cleanup operations

### 2. CloudWatch Metrics for iOS Notification Success/Failure Rates ✅
- **File**: `src/utils/metrics.ts`
- **Enhanced Methods**:
  - `recordIOSNotification()` - Records delivery success/failure
  - `recordIOSDeviceRegistration()` - Tracks registration metrics
  - `recordAPNSCertificateHealth()` - Certificate health metrics
  - `recordIOSPayloadMetrics()` - Payload size and delivery time
  - `recordIOSFallbackUsage()` - Fallback channel usage

### 3. CloudWatch Alarms for APNS Certificate Expiration Warnings ✅
- **File**: `src/infrastructure.ts`
- **New Alarms**:
  - `APNSCertificateExpirationWarningAlarm` - 30-day warning
  - `APNSCertificateExpirationCriticalAlarm` - 7-day critical alert
  - `iOSFallbackUsageAlarm` - High fallback usage detection
  - Enhanced dashboard widgets for certificate monitoring

### 4. Structured Logging for iOS Device Registration and Notifications ✅
- **Files**: 
  - `src/tools/ios-management-tool.ts`
  - `src/tools/alert-tool.ts`
  - `src/agent.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Correlation IDs for tracking operations
  - Detailed context logging for all iOS operations
  - Error categorization and structured error messages
  - Performance metrics logging
  - Health check result logging

### 5. Graceful Fallback When iOS Notifications Fail ✅
- **File**: `src/tools/alert-tool.ts`
- **Method**: `sendSpendAlertWithIOSMonitoring()`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic detection of iOS-related errors
  - Fallback to email/SMS when iOS delivery fails
  - Comprehensive error tracking and reporting
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Detailed metrics for fallback usage

### 6. Comprehensive iOS Monitoring Service ✅
- **File**: `src/utils/ios-monitoring.ts`
- **Class**: `iOSMonitoringService`
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive health checks for all iOS components
  - Automated recovery actions for common issues
  - Certificate expiration monitoring and warnings
  - Device token cleanup and management
  - Performance monitoring and optimization
  - Integration with main agent for proactive monitoring

## Enhanced Infrastructure

### CloudWatch Dashboard Enhancements
- **APNS Certificate Health** widget showing:
  - Days until certificate expiration
  - Certificate validation status
  - Warning and error counts
- **iOS Fallback and Error Recovery** widget showing:
  - Fallback usage rates
  - Payload sizes and delivery times
  - Recovery action success rates

### Alarm Configuration
- **Certificate Expiration Monitoring**:
  - 30-day warning threshold
  - 7-day critical threshold
  - Automatic SNS notifications to operational team
- **High Fallback Rate Detection**:
  - Triggers when iOS fallback is used frequently
  - Indicates potential iOS system issues

## Integration with Main Agent

### Enhanced Agent Initialization
- **File**: `src/agent.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive iOS health check during startup
  - Automated recovery attempts during initialization
  - Enhanced error handling and logging
  - Integration with iOS monitoring service

### Runtime Monitoring
- Periodic iOS system status checks
- Emergency health checks on iOS errors
- Enhanced error categorization and handling
- Proactive monitoring of notification delivery

## Testing Implementation

### Comprehensive Test Suites
1. **`tests/ios-monitoring-comprehensive.test.ts`**:
   - Complete health check scenarios
   - Automated recovery testing
   - Performance and resilience testing
   - Error scenario coverage

2. **`tests/ios-error-scenarios.test.ts`**:
   - Certificate expiration scenarios
   - Device token validation errors
   - Platform application failures
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Cascading failure handling

## Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 6.8: Multi-channel notification resilience ✅
- Implemented graceful fallback from iOS to email/SMS
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Detailed logging and metrics for troubleshooting

### Requirement 7.5: Invalid token handling ✅
- Automated APNS feedback processing
- Invalid token detection and cleanup
- Comprehensive logging of cleanup operations
- Metrics tracking for token validity rates

### Requirement 7.7: iOS system health monitoring ✅
- Comprehensive health checks for all iOS components
- Certificate expiration monitoring and alerting
- Automated recovery actions for common issues
- Integration with CloudWatch alarms and dashboards

## Key Benefits

1. **Proactive Monitoring**: Early detection of iOS system issues before they impact users
2. **Automated Recovery**: Self-healing capabilities for common iOS notification problems
3. **Comprehensive Observability**: Detailed metrics and logging for troubleshooting
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms ensure alert delivery even when iOS fails
5. **Operational Alerting**: CloudWatch alarms notify operations team of critical issues

## Usage

The iOS monitoring and error handling is automatically integrated into the spend monitor agent. When iOS configuration is provided:

1. **Initialization**: Comprehensive health check and automated recovery
2. **Runtime**: Continuous monitoring and proactive error handling
3. **Alert Delivery**: Enhanced delivery with fallback capabilities
4. **Maintenance**: Automated cleanup and certificate monitoring

## Monitoring and Alerting

Operators can monitor iOS system health through:
- CloudWatch Dashboard: Real-time metrics and health status
- CloudWatch Alarms: Proactive notifications for critical issues
- Application Logs: Detailed troubleshooting information
- Metrics: Historical trends and performance analysis

This implementation provides enterprise-grade iOS notification reliability with comprehensive monitoring, automated recovery, and graceful degradation capabilities.
