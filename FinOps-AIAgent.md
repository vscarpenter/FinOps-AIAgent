# FinOps AI Agent - Simplified Overview

## What is this application?

The FinOps AI Agent is an intelligent AWS cost monitoring system that automatically watches your AWS spending and alerts you when costs exceed your budget. Think of it as a smart financial watchdog for your AWS account that never sleeps.

## Why do you need it?

AWS bills can surprise you. Services running longer than expected, misconfigured resources, or forgotten instances can lead to unexpected charges. This agent proactively monitors your spending and alerts you before small costs become big problems.

## How does it work?

### The Simple Flow
1. **Daily Check**: Every day at 9 AM UTC, the agent wakes up
2. **Cost Analysis**: It asks AWS "How much have we spent this month?"
3. **Threshold Check**: It compares your spending against your budget ($10 by default)
4. **Smart Alert**: If you're over budget, it sends you a detailed alert via email or SMS

### The Technical Flow
```
EventBridge Timer → Lambda Function → Cost Explorer API → SNS Notifications
     (Daily)           (AI Agent)        (Get Costs)       (Send Alerts)
```

## Key Components

### 1. AI Agent (The Brain)
- Built using AWS Strands framework
- Makes intelligent decisions about when and how to alert
- Analyzes spending patterns and trends
- Provides detailed cost breakdowns by AWS service

### 2. Cost Explorer Integration
- Connects to AWS's native cost tracking service
- Retrieves real-time spending data
- Analyzes costs by service (EC2, S3, Lambda, etc.)
- Calculates monthly projections based on current usage

### 3. Smart Alerting System
- Uses AWS SNS for reliable message delivery
- Supports both email and SMS notifications
- Includes detailed cost breakdowns in alerts
- Only sends alerts when thresholds are exceeded

### 4. Automated Scheduling
- Uses AWS EventBridge for reliable daily execution
- Runs serverlessly - no servers to manage
- Scales automatically with your AWS usage

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework
- **AWS Strands**: AI agent framework for building intelligent AWS automations
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development with modern JavaScript features
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for serverless execution

### AWS Services Used
- **Lambda**: Serverless compute for running the agent
- **Cost Explorer**: AWS's native cost analysis service
- **SNS**: Simple Notification Service for alerts
- **EventBridge**: Event-driven scheduling system
- **IAM**: Identity and access management for security
- **CloudWatch**: Logging and monitoring

### Development Tools
- **AWS CDK**: Infrastructure as Code for easy deployment
- **Jest**: Testing framework for reliability
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency

## What makes it "AI"?

The agent uses intelligent decision-making to:
- **Analyze Trends**: Understands if spending is normal or unusual
- **Predict Costs**: Projects monthly totals based on current usage patterns
- **Smart Filtering**: Only alerts on meaningful cost changes, not minor fluctuations
- **Context Awareness**: Provides detailed breakdowns to help you understand where money is being spent

## Benefits

### For Individuals
- Prevents surprise AWS bills
- Learns your spending patterns
- Provides peace of mind for personal projects

### For Teams
- Shared visibility into team spending
- Automated budget enforcement
- Detailed cost attribution by service

### For Learning
- Demonstrates modern AI agent patterns
- Shows AWS Strands framework capabilities
- Provides real-world serverless architecture example

## Configuration Options

- **Spend Threshold**: Default $10/month (easily configurable)
- **Alert Frequency**: Daily monitoring (can be adjusted)
- **Notification Methods**: Email, SMS, or both
- **Cost Granularity**: Service-level breakdown available

## Deployment

The entire system deploys as Infrastructure as Code using AWS CDK:
```bash
npm install    # Install dependencies
cdk deploy     # Deploy to AWS
```

No servers to manage, no ongoing maintenance required. The agent runs automatically and scales with your needs.

## Security & Permissions

The agent follows AWS security best practices:
- Minimal IAM permissions (read-only access to Cost Explorer)
- Secure SNS topic configuration
- No sensitive data storage
- Audit trail through CloudWatch logs
