# FinOps AI Agent - Comprehensive Overview

## What is this application?

The FinOps AI Agent is an enterprise-grade, intelligent AWS cost monitoring and device management system built with AWS Strands framework. It's a comprehensive solution that not only monitors AWS spending but also provides sophisticated iOS device management, multi-channel alerting, automated recovery, and real-time health monitoring. Think of it as a complete FinOps platform that combines cost intelligence with modern notification infrastructure.

## Why do you need it?

Modern cloud operations require more than simple cost alerts. This agent addresses multiple critical challenges:

- **Proactive Cost Management**: AWS bills can surprise you with unexpected charges from misconfigured resources or forgotten instances
- **Multi-Channel Notifications**: Modern teams need alerts delivered through multiple channels (email, SMS, iOS push notifications)
- **Device Management**: iOS mobile notifications require sophisticated device registration and token management
- **Operational Intelligence**: Need comprehensive monitoring, metrics, and automated recovery capabilities
- **Enterprise Reliability**: Requires robust error handling, retry logic, and health monitoring

## How does it work?

### The Complete Flow
1. **Scheduled Execution**: EventBridge triggers the agent on a configurable schedule (daily by default)
2. **Comprehensive Health Check**: Validates all system components including APNS certificates and device endpoints
3. **Cost Analysis**: Analyzes AWS spending using Cost Explorer with intelligent trend analysis
4. **Threshold Intelligence**: Uses smart algorithms to determine if spending is normal or concerning
5. **Multi-Channel Alerting**: Sends notifications via email, SMS, and iOS push with automatic fallback
6. **Device Management**: Manages iOS device registrations, validates tokens, and handles APNS feedback
7. **Automated Recovery**: Performs self-healing actions when issues are detected
8. **Metrics & Monitoring**: Records detailed metrics for operational observability
