# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AWS Spend Monitoring Agent built using the AWS Strands framework. The agent will autonomously monitor AWS spending and generate alerts when spending exceeds predefined thresholds. The initial implementation will focus on detecting monthly spending over $10 and sending notifications to alert users of potential cost overruns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AWS account owner, I want to automatically monitor my monthly AWS spending, so that I can stay within my budget and avoid unexpected charges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent runs THEN the system SHALL retrieve current month-to-date AWS spending data using AWS Cost Explorer API
2. WHEN retrieving cost data THEN the system SHALL handle API rate limits and errors gracefully
3. WHEN cost data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN the agent completes a monitoring cycle THEN the system SHALL log the current spending amount and timestamp

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AWS account owner, I want to receive alerts when my spending exceeds $10 per month, so that I can take immediate action to control costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN current month spending exceeds $10 THEN the system SHALL generate an alert notification
2. WHEN generating an alert THEN the system SHALL include current spending amount, threshold exceeded, and breakdown by service
3. WHEN an alert is triggered THEN the system SHALL send the notification via AWS SNS
4. WHEN SNS is configured THEN the system SHALL support multiple notification channels: email, SMS, and iOS push notifications
5. IF SNS delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry notification delivery up to 3 times
6. WHEN an alert is successfully sent THEN the system SHALL log the alert details and delivery confirmation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AWS account owner, I want the monitoring agent to run automatically on a schedule, so that I don't have to manually check my spending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL execute monitoring checks every 24 hours using AWS EventBridge
2. WHEN a scheduled execution starts THEN the system SHALL initialize all required AWS service clients
3. WHEN the agent execution completes THEN the system SHALL log execution duration and status
4. IF an execution fails THEN the system SHALL log the error details and continue with the next scheduled run

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AWS account owner, I want to configure the spending threshold and notification settings, so that I can customize the monitoring to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the agent THEN the system SHALL accept a configurable spending threshold parameter
2. WHEN deploying the agent THEN the system SHALL accept a configurable SNS topic ARN for notifications
3. WHEN the configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail deployment with clear error messages
4. WHEN the agent starts THEN the system SHALL validate all configuration parameters before proceeding

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AWS account owner, I want the agent to provide detailed cost breakdowns in alerts, so that I can understand which services are driving my costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating an alert THEN the system SHALL include cost breakdown by AWS service
2. WHEN retrieving cost data THEN the system SHALL group costs by service name
3. WHEN costs are below the reporting threshold ($1) THEN the system SHALL group them as "Other services"
4. WHEN formatting the alert message THEN the system SHALL present costs in descending order by amount

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an AWS account owner, I want to receive notifications through multiple channels (email, SMS, iOS push), so that I can get immediate alerts regardless of which device I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring notifications THEN the system SHALL support email subscriptions to the SNS topic
2. WHEN configuring notifications THEN the system SHALL support SMS subscriptions to the SNS topic  
3. WHEN configuring notifications THEN the system SHALL support iOS push notification subscriptions via SNS Mobile Push
4. WHEN setting up iOS push notifications THEN the system SHALL create an SNS platform application for APNS
5. WHEN an iOS device registers THEN the system SHALL store the device token as an SNS platform endpoint
6. WHEN sending iOS push notifications THEN the system SHALL format messages with proper APNS payload structure
7. WHEN multiple subscribers exist THEN the system SHALL deliver alerts to all configured notification channels simultaneously
8. WHEN a notification channel fails THEN the system SHALL continue delivering to other channels and log the failure
9. WHEN iOS push notification setup is required THEN the system SHALL provide configuration instructions for APNS certificates

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to easily configure iOS push notifications for the spend monitor, so that I can receive immediate alerts on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the infrastructure THEN the system SHALL create an SNS platform application configured for Apple Push Notification Service (APNS)
2. WHEN configuring APNS THEN the system SHALL accept Apple Developer certificate and private key parameters
3. WHEN a new iOS device needs registration THEN the system SHALL provide an API endpoint to register device tokens
4. WHEN registering a device token THEN the system SHALL create an SNS platform endpoint and associate it with the spend alert topic
5. WHEN device tokens expire or become invalid THEN the system SHALL handle APNS feedback and remove invalid endpoints
6. WHEN sending push notifications THEN the system SHALL format alerts with iOS-specific payload including badge count and sound
7. IF APNS certificate expires THEN the system SHALL log clear error messages and continue with other notification channels

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to be built using AWS Strands framework patterns, so that it follows best practices and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the agent THEN the system SHALL extend the base Agent class from AWS Strands
2. WHEN implementing functionality THEN the system SHALL use separate Tool classes for AWS service interactions
3. WHEN implementing the monitoring logic THEN the system SHALL use Task classes for structured work units
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and logging throughout
5. WHEN the agent initializes THEN the system SHALL register all tools and tasks following Strands patterns
